## Prerequisites

- Sudo privileges (administrator access).

## Installation Steps

1. **Update Package Lists**

   Refresh your package lists to ensure you're installing the latest available packages:

   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Upgrade Installed Packages**

   Upgrade all your currently installed packages to their latest versions:

   A reboot is recommended to complete the upgrade process and apply any changes:

4. **Install the RTL8821AU Driver**

   Once your system has restarted, install the RTL8821AU driver using DKMS:

   ```bash

   ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Adapter Not Recognized:**
